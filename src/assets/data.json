They were released in 2014 and were the first iPhones to feature larger screens, which made them more appealing to a wider range of users. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were also successful because they were well-timed. They were released just as the smartphone market was starting to mature and consumers were looking for more powerful and feature-rich devices. Other iPhone models that have sold well include the iPhone 5s, iPhone 7, and iPhone 12. However, none of these models have come close to the sales of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. ",
